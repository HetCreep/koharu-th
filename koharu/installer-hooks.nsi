; NSIS installer hooks for Koharu — wired up via tauri.conf.json
;   bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks
;
; Tauri's default uninstaller removes the app binaries + Start Menu
; entries + registry keys, but leaves %LOCALAPPDATA%\Koharu\ behind.
; That folder holds ~1-3 GB of downloaded CUDA dylibs + HF model cache
; + custom fonts + recent-projects.json. Most users don't realise it
; exists, so on uninstall we offer to clean it up.
;
; Project files (.khr databases, chapter folders, render output) are
; NEVER inside %LOCALAPPDATA%\Koharu — those live in user-chosen
; locations and are untouched regardless of which button the user
; picks here.
;
; ─── SAFETY BELTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
; This hook is deliberately paranoid. Recent industry examples (a
; Thai game studio's uninstaller that wiped an entire drive when its
; config-file install-path lookup returned empty) inform every guard
; below:
;
;   1. Target path is HARDCODED to `$LOCALAPPDATA\Koharu`. We never
;      read from a config file, registry value, or anything else
;      that could be empty / tampered with.
;   2. Refuse outright if `$LOCALAPPDATA` resolves to an empty string
;      (would otherwise mean `RMDir /r "\Koharu"` against drive root).
;   3. Ownership check before any destructive op — at least one of
;      our known marker files/folders must exist at the target. If
;      a user has somehow ended up with a `Koharu` folder there from
;      another app or by accident, we leave it alone.
;   4. Delete by NAMED subfolder, not the parent recursively. Blast
;      radius of any junction-following bug is bounded to a folder
;      koharu itself created.
;   5. Final parent cleanup uses `RMDir` (no `/r`) so it only succeeds
;      if the parent is empty — preserves any unknown files the user
;      may have dropped into the folder manually.
